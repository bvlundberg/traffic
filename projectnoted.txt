	- Intersection
		- Receive notfication of arriving cars
		- Notify cars in two directions to pass through (opposite directions)
		- Count cars passing in a direction
	- Cars
		- Request to pass (arrive)
		- drive through intersection
		- notify intersection when passed through 

- Setup
- Build list of random cars

- Implementation
- Intersection
	- wait for cars to arrive (sleep) (condition alert intersection signal)
	- receive request to pass from a car (signal from car)
	- when it is time for the head of the queue to pass, open intersection to opposite directions
- Car
	- arrives at the intersection (In queue)  (signal Intersection)
	- wait to pass through
	- drive through intersection (3 seconds) (receive lock and run)
	- leave intersection (Out queue) (signal intesection or next car)
